I am a former comparative evolutionary biologist who entered the world of government consulting. I use my extensive analytical toolkit to improve health outcomes for Veterans.

My interests include:

- Comparative Biomechanics
- Ecophysiology
- Biogeography
- Social Determinants of Health

I am also available for consulting on experimental design and data analysis, and enjoy helping out my former academic friends and colleagues.
