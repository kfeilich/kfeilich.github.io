      title: Selected Projects
      text: Here are a selection of research projects that I have worked on over the years.

        - title: Cichlid Morphological Evolution
          description: Cichlid fin and body shapes have changed together overtime in ways consistent with hypotheses of locomotor specialization. Using x-ray radiography, I measured fin and body shape geometries across the lineage of cichlids to determine how this anatomy has changed over time.

        - title: Defining Fish Swimming Gaits
          description: Unlike humans, fishes use more than two limbs to get around--they use multiple fins and their bodies. This makes it difficult to compare the different ways they propel themselves through the water. I adapted methods applied to four-legged animals to create an approach for comparing steady swimming across fishes that use multiple propulsors.

        - title: Biogeography of Phenotypic Diversity
          description: Freshwater fishes are incredibly diverse, but measurements of how this diversity is distributed over the planet typically focus on the number of species in any given place. Other metrics of diversity may paint a different picture, especially when considering evolutionary "hotspots". I used North American freshwater fishes as a model system to map body shape diversity, body size diversity, and speciation rates across the geographic landscape.
